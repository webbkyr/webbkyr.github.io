home-page-quote: To overcome our greatest fears, we have to confront them, like a child lifting the covers, grabbing a flashlight, and peering under the bed to make sure that the boogieman isn’t there after all. Or maybe he is. But at least now you can see him fully. Knowing what you are up against, you can brace yourself, then gather the energy for the fight. — Bozoma Saint John
