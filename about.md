Hey, world 👋🏾. 

My name is Kayla, and I am a backend engineer at a San Francisco-based martech [startup](https://clearbit.com). Previously, I built tools for government affairs professionals at [Bloomberg](https://about.bgov.com/).

Day-to-day, I build reliable data pipelines, secure APIs and other backend services in Ruby (80%) and Go (20%). I worked in politics early in my career, but I caught the tech bug in 2015 and have been hooked ever since.

## Fast Facts

🤓 Studied political science at Howard University (The REAL HU, IYKYK 😜). I'm still a bit of a political nerd.

💻 Attended a full time coding [bootcamp](https://www.thinkful.com/). I picked up SQL on the job as a data analyst, but I learned all things web development (from scratch!) at the bootcamp. 

🏋🏾‍♀️ I LOVE weightlifting (and CrossFit!). I live a double life as a competitive athlete and an engineer. Personal bests include a 200lb clean, 165lb snatch, 245lb back squat and 310lb deadlift.
